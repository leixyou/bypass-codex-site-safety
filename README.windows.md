# Windows guide — bypass-codex-site-safety

Windows port of [bypass-codex-site-safety](README.md). It turns on Codex / ChatGPT
Desktop **Browser Use local-testing mode** (`BROWSER_USE_SECURITY_MODE=disabled-for-local-testing`),
so the cloud `aura/site_status` ("site-safety policy") check is skipped for every
`http://` / `https://` site.

## Requirements

| Component | Needed |
|---|---|
| Windows | 10 or 11 (x64) |
| Codex / ChatGPT Desktop | installed and run once, so `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` exists |
| Python | 3.9+ (`python`, `python3` or the `py` launcher on PATH) |

## Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/leixyou/bypass-codex-site-safety.git
cd bypass-codex-site-safety
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

With no arguments that is exactly:

```powershell
python codex_browser_lab.py install --preset shopping-cn --persist
```

Then **start a new Codex thread** (see below for why).

## The Windows-specific obstacle

Codex desktop on Windows behaves differently from macOS in two ways that decide
the whole design. Both were verified on build `26.915.4065.0`
(plugin `26.915.31945`):

**1. Codex regenerates its managed config block on every launch.**
`[mcp_servers.node_repl]` (`args`, `command`, `env_vars`, `startup_timeout_sec`),
its `[mcp_servers.node_repl.env]` table and the plugin's `.mcp.json` are rewritten
from Codex's own template. Any key added there — including in `env_vars` — is
removed the next time the app starts. Tables Codex does not own, such as
`[browser_use.origins.*]`, are left alone.

**2. Codex builds `node_repl`'s environment itself; it does not inherit it.**
The variable propagates `explorer.exe → ChatGPT.exe → codex.exe`, but the
`node_repl.exe` children are spawned with a synthesised environment: the standard
system variables plus the `env` table plus the `env_vars` allowlist. Setting
`BROWSER_USE_SECURITY_MODE` as a Windows user environment variable (`setx`,
`HKCU\Environment`) therefore has **no effect** — it never reaches `node_repl`.

So the only working channel is `[mcp_servers.node_repl.env]`, re-applied *after*
each Codex launch. That is what `--persist` does on Windows:

| Mechanism | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Watcher** (`watch`) | HKCU `...\Run` autostart; polls every 2 s | re-applies the patch within ~2 s of Codex rewriting it |
| **Scheduled Task** `CodexBrowserLabRepair` | every 5 min (`--interval MIN`) | safety net when the watcher is not running |

Codex spawns `node_repl` lazily, per session — it is not tied to app start. So the
sequence is:

1. Codex starts and wipes the patch.
2. The watcher re-applies it within ~2 seconds.
3. You open a **new Codex thread** → its `node_repl` is spawned while reading the
   re-patched config, and carries the flag.

`node_repl` processes warmed up at app start, before the watcher ran, keep the old
environment — that is exactly what `status` reports as `mode=<unset>`.

## macOS vs Windows

| | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Injection point | bash wrapper `exec`ing the signed `node_repl`; `command` is repointed | `[mcp_servers.node_repl.env]` only — `command` stays the official binary |
| Wrapper file | `~/.codex/mcp-wrappers/node-repl-security-mode.sh` | none |
| Persistence | LaunchAgent with `WatchPaths` | HKCU `Run` watcher + Scheduled Task |
| `node_repl` discovery | `/Applications/{ChatGPT,Codex}.app/...` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\runtimes\cua_node\*\bin\node_repl.exe`, else the `command` already in `config.toml` |
| Live check | `pgrep` + `ps eww` | toolhelp32 + reading each process's PEB environment block (`ReadProcessMemory`) |

## Commands

```powershell
# is it active?
.\install.ps1 status

# skip site_status only; do not touch origin allowlists
.\install.ps1 install --persist

# extra local allowlist entries (optional)
.\install.ps1 install --persist --preset shopping-cn --allow pixiv.net

# slower safety net (minutes)
.\install.ps1 install --persist --interval 15

# preview, no writes
.\install.ps1 install --preset shopping-cn --dry-run

# run the watcher in the foreground (debugging)
.\install.ps1 watch --interval 2

# uninstall (keeps origin allowlists)
.\install.ps1 uninstall
```

## Files it changes on Windows

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `~/.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.node_repl.env]` | adds `BROWSER_USE_SECURITY_MODE` (the actual bypass) |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` `[browser_use.origins.*]` | optional origin allow tables (`--preset` / `--allow`) |
| `~/.codex/browser/config.toml` | optional `allowed` arrays |
| `~/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-bundled/unified-computer-use/*/.mcp.json` | CUA env flag |
| `~/.codex/mcp-wrappers/` | installed tool copy, `repair` shim, watcher log, `backups/` of every file touched |
| `HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run\CodexBrowserLabWatch` | autostarts the watcher |
| Scheduled Task `CodexBrowserLabRepair` | periodic repair |

`backups/` keeps a timestamped copy of each file before it is written; names are
derived from the path relative to `CODEX_HOME`, so `config.toml` and
`browser/config.toml` never overwrite each other's backup.

## Verify

```powershell
.\install.ps1 status
```

Healthy output:

```text
platform            win32
CODEX_HOME          C:\Users\<you>\.codex
official node_repl  ...\runtimes\cua_node\<hash>\bin\node_repl.exe
watcher             running=True autostart=True
persist             CodexBrowserLabRepair=installed CodexBrowserLabRepairLogon=absent
repair shim         ...\mcp-wrappers\codex-browser-lab-repair.cmd exists=True
config command      ...\runtimes\cua_node\<hash>\bin\node_repl.exe
config security     disabled-for-local-testing
config ok           True
live pid=1234       mode=disabled-for-local-testing      <- after opening a NEW thread
```

Exit codes: `0` active, `2` config not patched, `3` config patched but the running
processes still carry the old environment (start a new Codex thread).

Watch the watcher work:

```powershell
Get-Content ~\.codex\mcp-wrappers\codex-browser-lab.log -Tail 20
```

`mode=<unreadable>` for a live PID means `ReadProcessMemory` was refused for that
process; the config check is authoritative regardless.

## Uninstall

```powershell
.\install.ps1 uninstall
```

Stops the watcher, removes the HKCU autostart value, deletes `CodexBrowserLabRepair`
and the `.cmd` shim, and strips `BROWSER_USE_SECURITY_MODE` from `config.toml` and
the CUA `.mcp.json`. Origin allowlists are left in place unless you delete them
from `config.toml` yourself.

## Limits

- **New thread required:** the patch only reaches `node_repl` processes spawned
  after it was re-applied. Threads opened at app start keep the old environment.
- **Model refusal:** if an old thread already saw a `site_status` error, the model
  may refuse to continue ("no workarounds"). Use a new thread.
- **Computer Use:** Chrome sitting on a blocked URL can still abort a Computer Use
  session. This tool only covers Browser Use / the Chrome plugin.
- **Updates:** a Codex/ChatGPT update regenerates `config.toml`. The watcher covers
  this as long as it is running; without `--persist`, re-run `.\install.ps1`.
- **Logon Task is optional:** registering an `ONLOGON` Scheduled Task needs an
  elevated shell. It is skipped with a warning when not elevated; the 5-minute task
  already re-applies the patch shortly after a reboot.
- **Side effects:** `disabled-for-local-testing` bypasses more than
  `check-url-site-status` — it also removes user-consent prompts for
  `browser-history-read`, `browser-origin-access`, `check-navigation-url-policy`,
  `file-download`, `file-upload`, `full-cdp`, `page-asset-*` and
  `raw-cdp-destination-url`. The browser agent becomes more autonomous inside your
  own browser profile. Uninstall to restore the prompts.
